#Forewarning: This is just the stuff created by the department's tech team. If you're looking for academic activities for students to carry out, you'll need to forge your own, I'm afraid. 

This lab came about out of necessity because department visitors could not use our existing VM lab via VirtualBox. To that end, we have crafted this lab for anyone to tinker with, based on the brilliant work of the Linux server/Kali-linux image in Docker. 

I've included the docker files for this project as part of this repository, though you can also find the pre-compiled images in our docker hub here: https://hub.docker.com/u/edgehillcompsci
